      <h2>Importance of Veterinary Care</h2>
      <p>Adult dogs should have a complete veterinary examination at least once a year. Puppies need veterinary visits
         usually every 3 to 4 weeks until they are about 4 months old. Geriatric dogs (older than 7 to 8 years old) should 
         see their veterinarian twice a year or more frequently because illness is more common in older pets and it can be 
         identified sooner. Your veterinarian may recommend a wellness program for your pet, including routine blood work to 
         monitor for problems such as early kidney or liver disease.</p></article>
      
      <article>
      <h2>Signs of Illness</h2>
      <p>Because you are more familiar with your dog than anyone else, you should watch it carefully for subtle signs of 
        illness that another person or even a veterinarian may miss. General signs of illness include a lack of appetite or 
        decreased activity. Other more specific signs include vomiting and diarrhea, urinating more (or less) frequently, 
        coughing and sneezing, or a discharge from the eyes, ears, or nose. Illness can also show up as a loss of hair or 
        itchy areas on the skin or around the ears. Problems with the musculoskeletal system are often seen as stiffness or 
        lameness, such as not putting weight on a leg. If your dog shows any of these signs for more than a day or two, a visit 
        with your veterinarian is a good idea.</p></article>

      <h2>
          Giving Medication
      </h2>
      <p>
        Pills and chewable medications are usually relatively easy to administer to dogs. Most dogs will readily eat a pill 
        that is hidden in a small treat, such as a piece of cheese or a bit of peanut butter. Sometimes, gently holding the 
        dog's muzzle closed until you are sure that it has swallowed can be helpful. Liquid medications are sometimes prescribed, 
        particularly for puppies. Liquids can be given via a syringe into the rear of the dog's mouth by inserting the tip of the 
        syringe near the back teeth on either side. Holding the dog's head pointing partially upward can help prevent spills. 
        Spot-on products or other topical medications are administered directly on the coat or skin. If your dog needs eye drops 
        or ear medication, your veterinarian or veterinary technician will give you a demonstration. Regardless of the type of 
        medication or how it is to be given, it is important to read and follow all label instructions.

      <h2>
        Vaccinations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Vaccination is a key component of preventive medicine in dogs, just as in people. Vaccinations are given to stimulate 
        the immune system against infection before exposure to a disease. Several vaccines are routinely given to dogs as the 
        core defense against serious infectious illness (for example, distemper, parvovirus, rabies). Several others 
        (referred to as noncore) are important in certain regions and situations (for example, Bordetella, Lyme disease).
         Your veterinarian can advise which vaccines are necessary in your local area and circumstances.

        Traditionally, booster vaccinations have been given every year throughout the dog's life to ensure ongoing protection. 
        However, the need for yearly revaccination has been questioned in recent years. Some data indicate that after the first 
        year of life, immunity lasts long enough so that booster vaccinations are needed only every few years. However, 
        the debate is ongoing. Your veterinarian will be aware of the most recent findings and can advise you about the best 
        vaccination program for your pet.

      <h2>
        Parasite Control
      </h2>
      <p>
        The primary intestinal parasites of dogs include roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, and tapeworms. These worms damage 
        the digestive tract or interfere with absorption of essential nutrients, or both. Intestinal parasite infections are 
        diagnosed by finding worm eggs (or sometimes actual worms or worm segments) in fecal samples. Fecal samples should be 
        tested periodically (yearly or on the schedule recommended by your veterinarian) in all dogs and more frequently in puppies, 
        which are especially prone to parasite infection. These worms usually do not cause intestinal infection in people; however, 
        hookworm infections leading to abdominal pain and inflammation have developed in people with weakened immune systems. 
        Roundworm larvae also have the potential to infect people. When infective roundworm eggs are ingested, they can develop 
        into larvae in the intestine and potentially migrate into sensitive organs. This migration is much more likely to occur 
        in children and people with weakened immune systems. Sanitation is key to prevention because roundworm eggs take about 
        30 days to become infective; thus, promptly cleaning up feces from your yard can essentially eliminate potential exposure.

        Heartworm is an especially serious parasite that is transmitted by mosquito bites. These worms live in the major blood vessels 
        of the lung, causing inflammation of the blood vessels and potentially resulting in heart damage and early death. 
        Because treatment of heartworm infection carries a number of serious health risks and is also potentially fatal, 
        prevention is critical. The Companion Animal Parasite Council, an assembly of experts in veterinary medicine and 
        parasitology, recommend year-round heartworm prevention for dogs, because it is impossible to accurately predict 
        all times when mosquitoes will be present. Additionally, most heartworm preventives contain medications that also
         treat for intestinal parasites, which can be transmitted at all times of the year. Blood tests to check for 
         heartworm disease should be done yearly.
        
        Common external parasites include fleas, ticks, and mange mites. Monthly preventive treatments are available to 
        control fleas and ticks, and are administered as body sprays or “spot-on” preparations that are placed on the 
        skin between the shoulder blades. Mange mites can be detected by scraping the skin of infected areas for signs 
        of mites or their eggs. Signs of mange include red, scaly areas or bald patches on the skin, or both.

      <h2>
        Dental Care
      </h2>
      <p>
        Dogs need dental attention throughout their lives. You can help keep your dog's teeth and gums in good condition 
        by feeding dry food, providing certain toys (for example, “flossie”-style bones), brushing your dog's teeth 
        regularly, and following a program of professional dental cleanings and oral care performed by your veterinarian. 
        Good dental care reduces the development of plaque which, if untreated, can progress to gingivitis and periodontal 
        disease. In severe cases of dental disease, extraction is common.

      <h2>
        Grooming
      </h2>
      <p>
        Your dog's hair coat should be brushed regularly to remove shed hair and prevent hair mats. Grooming is 
        especially important for dogs with thick or shaggy hair coats that mat or tangle easily. Mats can irritate 
        the skin, and the moist, stuffy conditions underneath them leaves the skin more susceptible to bacterial or
         parasite infections. Mats should be removed with electric clippers (not scissors) to avoid cutting the skin 
         underneath. Periodic bathing with a pet shampoo is also important for maintaining healthy skin and fur.
          However, excessive bathing can irritate and dry the skin and hair. On average, most dogs do not need to be 
          bathed more than once a month, depending on time of year and weather conditions.
