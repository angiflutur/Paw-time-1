            <p>
                The ever-popular Labrador Retriever holds onto the top spot for the 30th year! That's an amazing achievement, 
                though not a surprising one for a lovable and enthusiastic breed like the Labrador. This breed has plenty of
                 energy, loves to spend time with their families, and has an incredibly kind nature. Labrador Retrievers are
                  extremely intelligent and love the challenge of training sessions. They need an active home where they have 
                  plenty of opportunities to play and run off steam.

                    2. French Bulldog
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The French Bulldog has gained popularity in recent years and jumped two places higher than last year. 
                    It's unlikely that they'll overtake the Labrador, but they're the most popular small breed by quite a margin. 
                    French Bulldogs have an adorable personality combined with low to moderate exercise requirements. 
                    They're a great choice for urban living. French Bulldogs are expensive, though, and have a few health issues that 
                    owners should read up on before taking the plunge.

                    <p>
                        The German Shepherd Dog has slipped down the rankings two places since 2019, but they have a strong 
                        following of loyal fans nevertheless. This breed has an exceptional work ethic and is prized as a 
                        working breed. They also make exceptional family pets, although they can be quite disinterested 
                        in strangers and visitors whom they don't know well. This active breed needs plenty of exercise and 
                        opportunities for mental stimulation.

                            The Golden Retriever consistently ranks as one of the most popular dog breeds and for good reason! 
                            These adorable dogs are affectionate and loyal but can also be focused and serious when working. 
                            They have a cheerful disposition and are always happy and eager to please their owners. 
                            That happy-go-lucky exterior masks a fierce intelligence and a strong work ethic, which makes 
                            them the go-to choice as guide dogs and the perfect family companion.

                        <p>
                            The chunky Bulldog has a look all of their own, with their muscular, low-slung bodies and cheerful broad smile. 
                            Despite their tough-looking exterior, this breed loves nothing more than to try and snuggle into their owner's
                             lap! They can easily put on weight, so they need a moderate amount of exercise. Care needs to be taken during 
                             the warmer months because their short muzzle means they can easily overheat. Bulldogs are not strong swimmers 
                             and should never be left unsupervised around water.

                        The Poodle can be found in three different sizes: Standard, Miniature, and Toy. The listed size 
                        and weights are for the Standard variety. All Poodles are incredibly smart, athletic, and trainable. 
                        They once had a reputation as a delicate city dog, but nothing could be further from the truth. If you're
                         looking for an active companion for outdoor adventures, they're a great choice. Also, the breed has resulted 
                         in many popular mixed breeds, like the Labradoodle, Cockapoo, and Goldendoodle.

                        The Beagle is incredibly loyal, but they also have an independent streak that you'll
                         see whenever they catch the scent of something interesting. This is a cheerful and happy
                          breed that never fails to make their owners smile. They adore company, which given their history as a pack dog, 
                          is not surprising. Beagles are an active breed, but they shouldn't be let off-leash or they may run off. 
                          Their love of following scents is so strong, they will frequently try to jump fences or burrow underneath 
                          them to follow that trail.

                          know, but they won't hold back from letting their loved ones know how much they adore them. Rottweilers have plenty 
                          of energy, which combined with their intelligence, means they need a home where they get plenty of mental and 
                          physical exercise on a regular basis.

                    <p>
                        The noble and enthusiastic German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) loves any activity that allows 
                        them to spend time in the great outdoors. They're an enthusiastic and noble breed and are equally 
                        at home at gundog trials as they are on an all-day hike. The intelligence of the GSP makes them a 
                        rewarding training partner, and whatever you want to teach them, they'll
                         be enthusiastic and committed to giving it their all.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                    10. Dachshund
                    </h2> 
                    <img class="imagine" src="imagini/abc.jpg"/>
                                                
                    <p>
                        The instantly recognizable Dachshund comes in two sizes and three coat types. Whatever 
                        size or coat they have, you'll never mistake them for another breed! This breed might be 
                        small, but they love to keep an active eye on whatever is happening in their neighborhood. 
                        Sometimes they can be a bit too enthusiastic. Given their history as a breed designed to take on fierce prey 
                        like badgers, this isn't too surprising. These little dogs are independent, intelligent, and incredibly endearing.
